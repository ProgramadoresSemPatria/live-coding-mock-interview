# Live Coding Mock Interview 5 - Blockchain Wallet Stats Dashboard
In pseudocode, implement a web dashboard with info about a given wallet in the blockchain.

## Constraints
- Pseudocode only, no real implementation needed
  - The more details the better: language, framework, libraries, but no in-depth implementation needed
  - Describe each logic step of your application
- Your communication will be the main evaluation point
- You can use the concepts of any blockchain you are most familiar with

## Features
- [ ] Query the blockchain for transaction data
- [ ] Aggregate data to get stats
  - [ ] Minimum transaction value
  - [ ] Maximum transaction value
  - [ ] Average transaction value
  - [ ] Sum of all transaction values
- [ ] Present stats in a dashboard

## Bonus Features
- [ ] Dashboard is responsive (describe features in pseudocode that would make the layout responsive)
- [ ] Layout components are detailed in the implementation (buttons, sliders, charts, etc.)
- [ ] Blockchain implementation is detailed and includes multiple features
- [ ] Implementation is optimal
